        Tackle the vicious cycle of riding, falling, stopping, pushing, chasing, overcoming, and dreaming.
        We are a local, independently owned bicycle shop. Our focus is to foster fellow cyclists' passionate connection with nature, friends, and themselves through biking.
        Vicious sells only the top-quality, industry-leading innovations in every cycling category, from the bicycles to the accessories. 
        We also specialize in custom work, ranging from customized build to fully custom. 
        We will find or build your dream bike with you, make sure you are comfortable and excited about riding it, help you accessorize it, and service it for years to come.

        There are two things that set Vicious Cycles apart: our custom work and our catalog of industry-leading bicycle brands. 
        Head over to our Products page to peruse our catalog of excellent machines and unique accessories.
        Let us tell you about our passion for biking on Our Story page.
        Check out our blog for updates about local rides, biking safety, bike maintenance, new products, and more.
